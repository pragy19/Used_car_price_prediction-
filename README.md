##  Overview
This project estimates used car prices using supervised learning models.  
The workflow includes:
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training & evaluation
- Saving the best model and preprocessor
- Predictions on new unseen car data

---

##  Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, outliers)  
- Feature engineering: horsepower, engine liters, car age, log transforms  
- Multiple models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- Performance evaluation using **RMSE** on the original price scale  
- Save & load trained models with `pickle`
